# Personal Budget Blitz 

## Description
Sometimes it's difficult to keep track of your budget and cashflow, especially while travelling with a spotty connection. This application will allow you to track expenses, even while offline, and update when you reconnect.

This application was designed to be a Progressive Web App. This also led to the greateast challenge as the Service Workers and ability to save the application, took some debugging to have the page operate properly.

  ## Contribute
  In it's current form, this acts a basic budget calculator. That being said, I could invision adding "budgeted accounts" in case you want to track multiple accounts as well as potential links to e-commerce sites (in case you want to "treat yo self" as Tom and Donna say). If you'd like to help me bring this vision to life or have other ideas that you believe would be awesome, please send me an email at the address below.
